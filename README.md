# PrintOS

This is the frontend of WSU-V's HP Capstone group project, Fall 2024 - Spring 2025. If you want to look at our backend application, it is available [here](https://github.com/amychisholm03/hp-capstone-2025-backend).

We were tasked with creating a full-stack cloud application that supports [Industrial Print](https://www.hp.com/us-en/industrial-digital-presses.html) customers visualize and optimize their print jobs and workflows.
